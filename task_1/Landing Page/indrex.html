			<h2>Network Security</h2>
			<img src="Images/cyber.jpg" alt="Network Security">
			<p>Secure your network against unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.</p>
			<br><p>Use strong passwords: Ensure that all network devices, including routers and switches, have strong, unique passwords. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to create a strong password that is difficult to guess.</p></br>
			<br><p>Install updates and patches: Regularly check for and install updates and patches for your network devices and software. These updates often include security fixes that can prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited by attackers.</p></br>
			<br><p>Use a firewall: A firewall acts as a barrier between your network and the outside world, filtering out unauthorized traffic and preventing attacks. Make sure your firewall is properly configured to block all unnecessary incoming and outgoing traffic.</p></br>
			<br> <p> Educate employees: Human error is a common cause of network security breaches. Educate employees on best practices for network security, such as avoiding suspicious emails and not sharing passwords or sensitive information.</p> </br>
			<br> <p>Use encryption: Use encryption to protect sensitive data transmitted over the network. This can include using secure protocols such as HTTPS for web traffic and VPNs for remote access to the network.</p> </br>

			<h2>Web Security</h2>
			<img src="Images/cyber 1.jpg" alt="Web Security">
			<p>Protect your website from hacking, malware, and other cyber threats.</p>
			<br> <p>Keep software up-to-date: Ensure that all web-related software, including the operating system, web server, and applications, are regularly updated with the latest security patches and fixes.</p> </br>
			<br> <p>Use HTTPS: Use HTTPS to encrypt web traffic between the server and the client. This protects sensitive data, such as login credentials and payment information, from being intercepted by attackers.</p> </br>
			<br> <p>Use strong authentication: Use strong authentication methods, such as two-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.</p> </br>
			<br> <p>Regularly backup data: Regularly backup website data and files to prevent data loss from security incidents, such as hacking or malware attacks.</p> </br>
			<br> <p>Conduct regular security audits: Regularly conduct security audits of the website and its infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.</p> </br>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h2>Mobile Security</h2>
			<img src="Images/cyber 2.jpg" alt="Mobile Security">
			<p>Secure your mobile devices against data breaches, theft, and other cyber threats.</p>
			<br> <p>Use a strong password or passcode: Set up a strong password or passcode to lock your device and prevent unauthorized access. Avoid using easily guessable passwords or passcodes, such as "1234" or "password".</p> </br>
			<br> <p>Keep software up-to-date: Ensure that your mobile device's operating system, apps, and security software are regularly updated with the latest security patches and fixes.</p> </br>
			<br> <p>Install apps from trusted sources: Only download and install apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. Be wary of downloading apps from third-party sources, as they may contain malware or other security threats.</p> </br>
			<br> <p>Use public Wi-Fi with caution: Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive activities, such as online banking or shopping, as these networks are often unsecured and can be easily intercepted by attackers.</p> </br>
			<br> <p>Enable remote wiping and backup: Enable the remote wiping and backup features on your mobile device in case it is lost or stolen. This allows you to remotely erase all data on the device and/or backup important data to a secure location.</p> </br>
